# CodeQuiz Generator

![Demo](./demo.gif)  <!-- Replace with the actual path to your demo GIF -->

**CodeQuiz Generator** is a full-stack web application built with **FastAPI** (backend) and **React** (frontend), featuring **Clerk** for user authentication, and deployed with **Docker**.  

Users can select a question difficulty (**Easy / Medium / Hard**), and the system uses an **LLM** to dynamically generate quiz questions. After answering, users receive **correct/incorrect** feedback with explanations. All solved questions are stored in the userâ€™s **history**, and each user has **50 Challenges remaining per day**.
